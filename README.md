# Learning REACT

This is just a repository of all my learning projects and other stuff related to React and Javascript.
It's more like a place to revisit in the future to remember somethings, could be considerate as a portfolio aswell.

If u get curious about which course I'm following throughout my journey, are these two:
Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)
React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
Both from udemy.

Feel free to ask me anything ;)
